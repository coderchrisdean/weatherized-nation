To view the weather forecast for a specific city, navigate to the deployed application and enter the name of the city in the search bar. The weather dashboard will display the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for the city. The city name will also be added to the search history. If you want to view the weather conditions for a previously searched city, simply click on the city name in the search history, and the dashboard will update to show the current weather and 5-day forecast for that city.
